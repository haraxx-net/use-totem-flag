### Requirements
 - Java 17 or newer
 - [WorldGuard](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/worldguard) (tested with WorldGuard 7.0.7, should work with anything newer and some older versions)

### Installation
 1. [Download](https://github.com/haraxx-net/use-totem-flag/releases) or build the most recent jar file (releases may be not up-to-date).
 2. Place the `.jar` file into your plugins folder among `WorldGuard`.

### Usage
The plugin adds the flag `use-totem` to WorldGuard, which you can set for any region (e.g. `/rg flag __global__ use-totem deny`).
